## Description
This project analyzes chemical reaction equilibria under different operating conditions, considering both ideal and non-ideal scenarios. MATLAB is used to compute equilibrium compositions and study the effects of temperature and pressure variations.

---

## Key Features
- Computed equilibrium compositions for acetaldehyde hydrogenation at elevated temperature and pressure.  
- Evaluated pressure effects using ideal and non-ideal gas models (Wilson and NRTL equations).  
- Implemented temperature-dependent Gibbs free energy and enthalpy calculations using heat capacity correlations.  
- Solved nonlinear equilibrium equations numerically in MATLAB.
